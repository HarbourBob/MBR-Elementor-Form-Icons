---

**Add Font Awesome icons to your Elementor Pro form fields — beautifully, simply, for free.**

Choose between two display modes: drop an icon *inside* the field as a placeholder, or place it *above* alongside the label. Control icon, colour, and size on a per-field basis, with full support for Elementor global colours and live editor preview updates.

No premium tier. No upsells. No vendor lock-in. Just a clean, well-built tool that does exactly what it says.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Two icon modes** — placeholder (inside the input) or above (next to the label)
- **Per-field controls** — individual icon, colour, and size for every field
- **Global colour support** — works seamlessly with Elementor's global colour system
- **Live editor preview** — icons update in real time as you edit in Elementor
- **Zero bloat** — Font Awesome is loaded from Elementor's own bundled copy; no extra HTTP requests if it's already on the page
- **Textarea aware** — icons pin to the top of multi-line fields rather than awkwardly centring
- **Clean injection** — pure JavaScript DOM injection; no PHP template overrides

2. In your WordPress dashboard go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**

## 🛠️ How It Works

Elementor Pro's form widget renders its fields client-side via JavaScript templates — standard PHP `render_content` filters get discarded milliseconds after the page loads. MBR Elementor Form Icons works around this by injecting icons purely via JavaScript after Elementor's render cycle completes.

On the **frontend**, field data (icon, colour, size, position) is baked server-side into a localised script variable (`mbrEfiData`) and injected once Elementor signals the widget is ready via `frontend/element_ready`.

In the **editor preview**, the plugin polls the live DOM and reads icon settings directly from Elementor's Backbone model — so changes in the settings panel are reflected in the preview without needing to save.

## 📝 Changelog

### 1.2.8
- Fixed global colours not applying on the frontend due to missing field type in localised data

### 1.2.7
- Fixed global colour CSS variables (`var(--e-global-color-*)`) being stripped by hex-only sanitization

### 1.2.6
- Fixed placeholder icon vertical alignment on single-line inputs — now centres within the input itself, not the field group
- Fixed textarea placeholder icons now pin to the top of the field

### 1.2.5
- Fixed jittery placeholder text shift during editor re-renders caused by orphaned `padding-left` on inputs

### 1.2.4
- Fixed editor preview injection when `elementor-field-group-{id}` classes are absent from the editor template — falls back to field type matching

### 1.2.3
- Fixed script execution context — injection now correctly targets the preview iframe
- Replaced unreliable event-based approach with polling for editor re-render detection

### 1.2.2
- Fixed icons disappearing after Elementor editor re-renders
- Fixed Font Awesome loading from Elementor's bundled copy with CDN fallback
